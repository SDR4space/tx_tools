# Signal generator definition
#
# The basic block is a "tone". A tone is defined by frequency, attenuation, and duration.
# A tone is enclosed in parens "(freq att dur)".
#
# A frequency is given in Hz or kHz. Giving a frequency implies 0dB, giving no frequency implies -100dB.
# The attenuation is given in dB, which is dBFS: 0dB is maximum level, -100dB is always assumed silence.
# The duration is given in units of seconds (s), milliseconds (ms), or microseconds (us).
#
# A symbol is a named sequence of tones. A symbol is defined in brackets "[symb tones and symbols...]".
#
# If you define the 0 and 1 symbol you can also use hex in braces "{...}" for output.
#
# Whitespace is ignored, except to separate arguments. Whitespace is space, tab, newline, and linefeed
# Comments begin with a hash sign "#", can start anywhere and run to end of the line.
# All symbols are one char, 7-bit ASCII. You can not use parens, brackets, braces, dot, or minus as symbols "()[]{}.-".

# 2315 baud on/off rate and alternating 579 baud bit rate and 463 baud bit rate
# Each transmission has a warmup of 17 to 32 pulse widths then 8 packets with
# alternating 1:3 / 2:2 or 1:4 / 2:3 gap:pulse ratio for 0/1 bit in the packet
# with a repeat gap of 4 pulse widths, i.e.:
# 7408 us to 13092 us warmup pulse, 1672 us gap,
# 0: 472 us gap, 1332 us pulse
# 1: 920 us gap, 888 us pulse
# 1672 us repeat gap,
# 0: 472 us gap, 1784 us pulse
# 1: 920 us gap, 1332 us pulse
# Example codes are: 80042 Arm alarm, 80002 Disarm alarm,
# 80008 System ping (every 15 minutes), 800a2, 800c2, 800e2 Motion event
